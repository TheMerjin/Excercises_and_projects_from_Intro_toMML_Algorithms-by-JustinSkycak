Overview

This repository is a collection of exercises and projects completed during the Intro to MML Algorithms course. The focus of these projects is to illustrate fundamental concepts in machine learning algorithms, mathematical modeling, and algorithmic problem solving. Each project includes source code, examples, and (where applicable) instructions on how to run and test the algorithms.

Key Topics Covered Include:

    Algorithm design and analysis

    Data structures and their applications in ML

    Optimization techniques

    Mathematical modeling in algorithms

    Practical projects and hands-on exercises

Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


├── project1_algorithm_name/
│   ├── README.md            # Detailed instructions and description for this project
│   ├── src/                 # Source code for the project
│   ├── examples/            # Example inputs, outputs, and test cases
│   └── ...
├── project2_algorithm_name/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── src/
│   ├── examples/
│   └── ...
└── general_exercises/
    ├── exercise1/
    ├── exercise2/
    └── ...

Each subfolder contains its own README file if additional details or instructions are required for that particular project/exercise.
Installation and Setup

Before running any of the code in this repository, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

    Python 3.10 or later (recommended version: 3.10)

    The required packages as listed in the respective project’s requirements.txt file (if available). To install dependencies for a specific project, use:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    (Optional) A LaTeX distribution for projects that involve rendering text using LaTeX (e.g., projects using Manim).

Usage

Each project folder includes detailed instructions on how to run the code. Generally, you can run the code by executing the main script for the project. For example:

python src/main.py

For projects using Manim to render animations, you can run:

manim -pql src/your_scene_file.py YourSceneClass

Be sure to check each project’s README for specific instructions and any required command-line arguments.
